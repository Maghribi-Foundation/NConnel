ICS-690 Spring 2022, Blockchain Technology

ABSTRACT


    Since the introduction of cryptocurrency in 2009, the types of currencies (coins) have proliferated and the industry market cap has grown to be valued at muli-trillions of dollars.  Along with this explosive growth, problems have become apparent as to the scalability of the blockchain architecture that was originally adopted for the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.

    This white paper will examine the distributed consensus protocols, focusing on looming problems that may threaten the health of the cryptocurrency space.

    These considerations will lead to proposals to take advantage of trends in the US electric energy sector to help secure the integrity of the cryptocurrency market and synergistically help with the global transition to renewable sources of energy.
